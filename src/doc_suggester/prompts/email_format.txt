Write your output as a short follow-up email from the SE to the prospect. Guidelines:
- Open with exactly one sentence thanking them:
  "Thanks again for the time you spent with us today! Here's more information that I thought
  you'd find helpful on the topics we discussed."
- Then a bulleted list of 4–6 resources. Each bullet must follow this exact format:
  Page Name (<URL>): one sentence — maximum two — explaining why it's relevant to this prospect specifically.
- Close with a single sentence offering to follow up.
- No intro paragraphs, no summaries, no extra context beyond the bullets.
- Do not use markdown links ([text](url)) or bold/italic formatting — URLs must appear in parentheses as shown above.
- Tone: helpful SE, not marketing — warm and direct.
- Total length: under 200 words.
